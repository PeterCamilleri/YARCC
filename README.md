# YARCC - Yet Another Ruby Compiler Compiler

This project contains the Ruby YARCC gem. A gem used to explore the use
of Ruby as a compiler construction platform. This particular archive has
started out as a test-bed for exploring ideas. As such it will likely end
up as throw-away code, part of the research and development process.
